SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems.
Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations. 
    
Software Architecture
1. Monolithic Architecture
2. Service Oriented Architecture (Micro services)
3. Service Based Architecture (5G)

A Monolithic architecture is the traditional unified model for the design of a software program. Monolithic means composed all in one piece.In a tightly-coupled architecture, each component and its associated components must be present in order for code to be executed or compiled.

     
		      USER INTERFACE   -------> LOGIC ------> DATA INTERFACE  -------> DATEBASE 
					
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service-oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies.	
  
Service-Based Architecture (SBA), whereby the control plane functionality and common data repositories of a 5G network are delivered by way of a set of interconnected Network Functions (NFs), each with authorization to access each other's services
 
 <strong>How to deploy websites</strong>
 
Purchase a Domain Name 
(If you are new you need to do is register a domain name.)
 
After building the Website/Project its time for deployment. Generally we are using Cloud Service for hosting the website on the Server.
Examples of cloud services include online data storage and backup solutions, Web-based e-mail services, hosted office suites and document collaboration services, database processing, managed technical support services and more.
With help of Cloud Service we get the fixed IP address (Public IP address) and another services which is important for website.
IP Address ---> 1.Private IP address  2.Public IP address

*Note :-Local host /127.0.0.1.( Private IP address)

Cloud Service Provider
 Amazon Web Services(AWS),
 Microsoft Azure ,
 Digital Ocean,
 IBM Cloud,
 Rackspace,
 Go Daddy etc;
 
<strong> CI/CD( Continous Integration Continous Deployment)</strong>
 
  A CI/CD pipeline helps you to automate step in your software delivery process,such as initialing code builds,running automated tests,and deploying to a production enviiroment.Automated pipelines remove manaul errors,provide standardized development feedback loops and enable fast product iterations.
	
CI,short for Continous Integration, is a software development practice in which all developers merge code changes in a central repository multiple times a day. CD stand for Continous Integration adds the practice os=f automating the entire software release process.
With CI, each change in code trigger an automated build and test sequences foe the given code.
CD includes infrastructure provisioning and deployment ,which may be manual ansd consist of multiple stages. What's important is that all these processes are fully automated with each run fully logged and visible to the entire team .

DevOps -(Development + Operations). is how modren developers are builing great products by using new methods of Continuous Integration,Continuous Delivery,(CI/CD) and Continuous Deployment.Most teams have automated processes to check in code and deploy to new environment.

<strong>Operating System (OS)</strong>

An operating system is the primary software that manages all the hardware and other software on a computer. The operating system, also known as an Operating System interfaces with the computer’s hardware and provides services that applications can use.
An operating system is the core set of software on a device that keeps everything together. Operating systems communicate with the device’s hardware. They handle everything from your keyboard and mice to the Wi-Fi radio, storage devices, and display. In other words, an operating system handles input and output devices. Operating systems use device drivers written by hardware creators to communicate with their devices.
UNIX </t>
LINUX </t>
WINDOWS etc,

UNIX 

Unix is a portable,multitasking,multiuser,time-sharing operting system (OS) originally developed in 1969 by a group of employees at AT&T.Unix was first programmed in assembly language but was reprogrammed in C in 1973.Unix has been ported to more machine families than any other operating system.

Developer -Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and others.
Written in :C, Assembly language 

LINUX
Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on 1991, by Linus Torvalds.Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution. Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.Linux is a freely distributable version of Unix.

Developer- Linus Torvalds
Written in :C, Assembly language ,

GNU-(GNU stands for GNU's Not UNIX. It is a UNIX like computer operating system, but unlike UNIX, it is free software and contains no UNIX code. It is pronounced as guh-noo. Sometimes, it is also written as GNU General Public License.)

Note:-<b> Git</b> was created by <strong> Linus Torvalds</strong> in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
The purpose of <b>Git</b>is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a repository.

Why use Linux ?

Linux makes very efficient use of the system's resources. ... This allows them to install Linux even on old hardware, thus helping in optimal use of all the hardware resources. Linux runs on a range of hardware
<strong>High stability:</strong> The Linux system is very stable and is not prone to crashes. The Linux OS runs exactly as fast as it did when first installed, even after several years.
<strong>Free:</strong> Linux is completely free and users do not need to pay for anything. All the basic software required by a typical user and even an advanced user are available.
<strong>Open source:<strong> The most important aspect of Linux is that its source code is available as it falls under the Free and Open Source Software.The developer community benefits from this as its members have the freedom to view and modify the source code.

WINDOWS 

Windows OS, computer operating system (OS) developed by Microsoft Corporation to run personal computers (PCs). Featuring the first graphical user interface (GUI) for IBM-compatible PCs, the Windows OS soon dominated the PC market.
Microsoft Windows. Operating system designed and produced by Microsoft Corporation. Similar to other operating systems, Windows makes a computer system user-friendly by providing a graphical display and organizing information so that it can be easily accessed.

KERNEL
Kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system. The kernel give interactions between hardware and software components.
